This is a simple castle destruction game with the intent of having a projectile reach a goal on the page.

One thing I did to increase variablity in the game was having alternating projectiles. There is a black projectile that weighs more with less friction, showcasing a dense ball in order to get through some of the castle bricks that tend to pileup in front of the goal. Then there is the normal gray projectile that is much lighter and bouncier, allowing you to try trickshots and bounce around. 

The game will start with the heavy projectile and then alternate between the normal and heavy projectile for every shot after, including between levels.
